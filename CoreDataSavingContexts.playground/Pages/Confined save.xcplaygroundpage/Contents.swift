//: ## Confined save
//:
//: Let's do it again, we setup our main context with "Billy"

import CoreData

let persistentStoreCoordinator = try createPersistentStoreCoordinator()
let mainContext = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .MainQueueConcurrencyType)
mainContext.persistentStoreCoordinator = persistentStoreCoordinator
let ourOtherPerson = addPersonToContext(mainContext, name: "Billy")

//: Then, to prevent "Billy" to be saved while we just wanted to save "John", we will not create our editing context as a child of the main.
//: We will create what we'll call a *sibling* context. These are contexts that share the same persitent store coordinator:

let siblingContext = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .MainQueueConcurrencyType)
siblingContext.persistentStoreCoordinator = persistentStoreCoordinator
let person = addPersonToContext(siblingContext, name: "John")

//: Now, all we have to do is save the sibling context:
try siblingContext.save()

//: Let's check that we can access our "John" from our main context:
let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest(entityName: "Person")
fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format:"%K like %@", "name", "John")
if let createdPerson = try mainContext.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest).first as? Person {
	print(createdPerson)	// "name: John"
} else {
	print("Noone there!")
}

//: Yes! Now let's see if "Billy" was saved:
let secondLaunchMainContext = NSManagedObjectContext(concurrencyType: .MainQueueConcurrencyType)
secondLaunchMainContext.persistentStoreCoordinator = persistentStoreCoordinator

fetchRequest.predicate = NSPredicate(format:"%K like %@", "name", "Billy")
if let createdPerson = try secondLaunchMainContext.executeFetchRequest(fetchRequest).first as? Person {
	print(createdPerson)
} else {
	print("Noone there!")	// "Noone there!"
}

//: We did it!
//:
//: ## Conclusion
//: 
//: Here, we learned that:
//: 
//: * calling `save()` on a context will only send changes one step up the hierarchy
//: * `save()` will commit changes contained in the whole context
//:
//: I hope that this may help anyone who did not yet grasp how Core Data save its content throught contexts.
//:
//:
//: __As a side note__: for the sake of simplicity here, we have only worked with entity insertion.
//: When you start playing with entity attributes, you'll need to perform some `refreshObject()` calls to see the saved values in other contexts.
